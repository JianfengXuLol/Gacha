-Gemshin Impact Wishing Pool

1.figure out the probability

-how to set up a probability to determine how often certain cards are drawn.

Step#1: Define an object(function) to control the probability of each card.

Step#2: We need a total weight.(ex: weight#1 + weight#2 = totalWeight)

Step#3: Create a array to store each card with a specified weight(odds)

Step#4: Define a function to add cards into the pool (the array list), and count the new weight to the totalWeight.

Step#5: Define a function to show the wishing result (display cards).

In detail: we need a random number to represent the range (like: 0-9, 0-99, …) using totalWeight , scan through the array to see if the random number is within the specified weight range. If yes, display the card. If no, subtract the new range (move to the weight range of next card in the list), for example: 109-100=9, which means if the random#(0-109) equals 101 (out of the range:0-99), then we move the weight range from (0-99) to weight range (0-9).

Step#6: Create the object of Step#1 and add new cards with specified weight(probability)

Step#7: Using the function from Step#5 to display the wishing result using a for loop (the loop range means how many cards will be drawn once, the ideal value is 10).

===========================================================================================
plans:
!look at chatGPT's code and solve the "Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY'" bug first!

Storing character's name into the database and get the count of constellation right.

ideas:

1.I want to create a Gemshin Impact restaurant simulation game, it combines this gacha system.
2.The core idea of this game will be using the gacha system to hire employees in order to help the restaurant. The income of the restaurant can be used to pull characters.
3.I want to come up with more features that are related to Gemshin impact, inspirations may come from mobs, element reactions, storyline, characters and etc...

(Gacha System)

on-going problem:

# -Within a 10-pull, only the last character card will be saved into the database, other cards get overwriten by the last character card on the screen(check the chatGPT code)

# -when we have same cards on the screen, then we get "Duplicate entry for PRIMARY" bug

(adding "AUTO INCREMENT" solves some of the problem, but there are still some weird issues:
1.the error is gone when $constellation=0, but it still exists otherwise(ex: when $constellation=-1,1,2,3,so on...)
2.when $constellation=0, the number goes from -1 to 14,15, which is super weird.
)

on-going problem:

When the artifacts timer is done, 质变仪 timer dissappears.
It seems like that the code stops at if (timeSpan <= 0){}, i need to look into this tomorrow.

solved problems & solutions:

(Gacha System)

# -preventing form being submitted when refreshing the page

solution: put the code at the bottom of the php file(html tag)

        <script>
    		if ( window.history.replaceState ) {

window.history.replaceState( null, null, window.location.href );
}
</script>

(Daily Routine)

# -Resin counter stops whenever I reloading or closing the page

using localstorage to save and retrieve, calculate then save and update values
